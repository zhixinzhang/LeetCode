HastMap VS Hashtable
1. HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code 
whereas Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
Based on my experience I use ConcurrentHashMap to handle multiple thread
2. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value.
HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed.
3. Hashtable extends dictorary class, hashmap extends abstractMap class


Major difference between lock and synchronized:
1. with locks, you can release and acquire the locks in any order.
2. with synchronized, you can release the locks only in the order it was acquired.

Dependency Injection in Spring
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it 
can be easy to manage and test the application. Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled.

Spring framework provides two ways to inject dependency
